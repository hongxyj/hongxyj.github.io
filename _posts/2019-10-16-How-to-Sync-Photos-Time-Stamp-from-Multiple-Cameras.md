For wedding and events shooting, we normally need multiple cameras to do the job.  Unless we calibrate and sync the clocks for all cameras before the events, we end up with a few sets of photos that have different time stamps. 

After import into lightroom, or copy to the computer, the sequence of the photos will not in proper order as the actual events, which is annoying.

## The Not So Elegant Methods:

When searching the web for a way to deal with this issue, you will find most of them teaching you a method that you must find some photos that were taken roughly at the same time by different cameras. To me this is not an elegant way to do, as it can be troublesome to search for those photos, and even you find them, they may not taken at the exactly the same time. 

There are others asking you to take a photo of your watches or clocks using the cameras simultaneously, done at exactly the same time. This again is probably not really needed

## The Easy and Practical Way to Sync

*The most practical way to sync multiple camera time stamp turns out to be very easy. Below is the step:*

>Take a reference photo of a watch or clock that shows clearly the current time using your camera

>Do the same using other cameras to be sync, you don't need to do this at the exact time, nor the exact date! So long you capture clearly the time you taking that photo is good enough

>Import all those photos together with your wedding /event photos into lightroom classic

>On the metadata field of reference photos, you will see the camera time stamp that is different from time in the watch!

>In lightroom library view, filter the photos by camera name or serial number if the cameras are same model

>Make sure the reference photo are on top (or the first photo in the series), and select all the photos

>Go to the metadata menu at the top of lightroom (library view). Looking for ”Edit Capture Time”, while on the reference photo view. Enter the correct time as show on the watch, and click “change all”

>Repeat the same steps for each camera mode


That’s all need to do!, all your photos should now be ordered properly in sequence.
